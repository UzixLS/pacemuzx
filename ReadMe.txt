Pac-Man Emulator for Sinclair Spectrum
--------------------------------------

This program requires a Spectrum +2A/+3, and will not work on earlier models.

The Pac-Man ROMs cannot be supplied with this program, so you must supply your
own copies of the following files:

  pacman.6e pacman.6f pacman.6h pacman.6j

Copy them to the same directory as this file, then run make.bat (Windows) or
make (Mac/Linux/Un*x) to build the final pacemuzx.tap image file.

Enjoy!
